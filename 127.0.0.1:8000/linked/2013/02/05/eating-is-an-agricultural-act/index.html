    	  	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_Berry">Wendell Berry</a> in 1989:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>I begin with the proposition that eating is an agricultural act. Eating ends the annual drama of the food economy that begins with planting and birth. Most eaters, however, are no longer aware that this is true. They think of food as an agricultural product, perhaps, but they do not think of themselves as participants in agriculture. They think of themselves as &#8220;consumers.&#8221; If they think beyond that, they recognize that they are passive consumers. They buy what they want — or what they have been persuaded to want — within the limits of what they can get. They pay, mostly without protest, what they are charged. And they mostly ignore certain critical questions about the quality and the cost of what they are sold: How fresh is it? How pure or clean is it, how free of dangerous chemicals? How far was it transported, and what did transportation add to the cost? How much did manufacturing or packaging or advertising add to the cost? When the food product has been manufactured or &#8220;processed&#8221; or &#8220;precooked,&#8221; how has that affected its quality or price or nutritional value?</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>&#8230;</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>But if there is a food politics, there are also a food esthetics and a food ethics, neither of which is dissociated from politics. Like industrial sex, industrial eating has become a degraded, poor, and paltry thing. Our kitchens and other eating places more and more resemble filling stations, as our homes more and more resemble motels. &#8220;Life is not very interesting,&#8221; we seem to have decided. &#8220;Let its satisfactions be minimal, perfunctory, and fast.&#8221; We hurry through our meals to go to work and hurry through our work in order to &#8220;recreate&#8221; ourselves in the evenings and on weekends and vacations. And then we hurry, with the greatest possible speed and noise and violence, through our recreation — for what? To eat the billionth hamburger at some fast-food joint hellbent on increasing the &#8220;quality&#8221; of our life? And all this is carried out in a remarkable obliviousness to the causes and effects, the possibilities and the purposes, of the life of the body in this world.</p>

            	    	<p>Was really feeling my left wrist, and found this:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>To that end, when people tell me theyâ€™re too busy to blog I invoke the principle of keystroke conservation. Was the email message you wrote to three people possibly of use to thirty, or three hundred, or thirty thousand? If so, consider blogging it â€” externally if thatâ€™s appropriate, or internally otherwise. Then, if you want to make sure those three people see the message, go ahead and email them a pointer to it.</p>
		<p>That simple maneuver can have powerful network effects. To exploit them, you have to realize that the delivery of a message, and the notification of delivery, do not necessarily coincide. Most of the time, in email, they do. The message is both notification and payload. But a message can also notify and point to a payload which is available to the recipient but also to other people and processes in other contexts. That arrangement costs hardly any extra keystrokes, and hardly any extra time. But itâ€™s an optimization that can radically expand influence and awareness.</p>

            	    	<blockquote>
		<p>Hereâ€™s why <span class="caps">PHP</span> is so popular: You donâ€™t have to learn much up-front. Start with an <span class="caps">HTML</span> page, drop in one measly function call, and you get immediate gratification. Need to do something else? Look up another function and drop it in. Over time, you get a head-full of function calls you can use in a pinch, and get to call yourself a programmer. Itâ€™s a double-edged sword. The fact that <span class="caps">PHP</span> takes no real study to become productive means there are millions of <span class="caps">PHP</span> developers who donâ€™t have a grasp of â€œrealâ€ programming concepts. Like me. That doesnâ€™t mean we arenâ€™t productive, but it does mean we tend to build things in non-optimal ways under deadline pressure. And we tend to build things that turn around and bite us in the ass when organizations and data models grow, change, and evolve, because our code is littered with secrets and mysteries, and because we lack the foundations needed to be â€œrealâ€ programmers. Iâ€™m generalizing grossly (and being unnecessarily self-deprecating) to make a point.</p>
		<p>For me, learning a framework has been another story. There is no â€œinstant gratificationâ€ entry point. You need to have a grasp of the language the framework is written in. For Django, that means learning some Python â€“ at the very least lists, dictionaries and tuples. You need to learn that languageâ€™s programming structures â€“ how it handles conditionals, loops, I/O, etc. You need to have some basic grounding in object-oriented programming principles â€“ something Iâ€™ve simply never gotten around to. In most cases â€“ certainly in Django â€“ you need to learn <span class="caps">MVC</span> (model view controller) or in Djangoâ€™s case <span class="caps">MTV</span> (model template view) principles. And you need to learn the framework itself. How it thinks, how data moves through the system, where to look when things go wrong.</p>
		<p>Finally, you need to know how to deploy. Because <span class="caps">PHP</span> is built into virtually every Apache host out there, deployment is something most <span class="caps">PHP</span> devs donâ€™t have to think about. For Rails or Django, itâ€™s a different story. Suddenly youâ€™re compiling apache modules, building database bindings, configuring the web serverâ€¦ or looking around for a host whoâ€™s done all of that for you.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Are you interested in turning this into a business? Maybe with some VC funding?</strong></p>
		<p>I&#8217;ve been approached several times, but it just didn&#8217;t feel right. When I&#8217;m 80, I want to feel that I helped give access to a world-class education to billions of students around the world. Sounds a lot better than starting a business that educates some subset of the developed world that can pay $19.95/month and eventually selling it to some text book company or something. I already have a beautiful wife, a hilarious son, two hondas and a decent house. What else does a man need?</p>
		<p>With that said, if you are a social venture capitalist and are looking to deploy capital with the highest possible social return per dollar invested, we should talk. I think you&#8217;ll find that there is no more measurable, scalable and high impact way to educate the world.</p>
		<p><strong>Where are you from? What ethnicity/religion are you?</strong></p>
		<p>I was born and raised in New Orleans, Lousiana. My mother was born in Calcutta, India. My father was born in Barisal, Bangladesh.</p>
		<p>If you believe in trying to make the best of the finite number of years we have on this planet (while not making it any worse for anyone else), think that pride and self-righteousness are the cause of most conflict and negativity, and are humbled by the vastness and mystery of the Universe, then I&#8217;m the same religion as you.</p>

		<p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was born on 10th December 1815, the only child of Lord Byron and his wife, Annabella. Born Augusta Ada Byron, but now known simply as Ada Lovelace, she wrote the worldâ€™s first computer programmes for the Analytical Engine, a general-purpose machine that Charles Babbage had invented.</p>
		<p>Ada had been taught mathematics from a very young age by her mother and met Babbage in 1833. Ten years later she translated Luigi Menabreaâ€™s memoir on Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine, appending notes that included a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the machine â€“ the first computer programme. The calculations were never carried out, as the machine was never built. She also wrote the very first description of a computer and of software.</p>

<p>GitHub is truly a system of anarchism, in the most classic sense of the term. It is a system of communication and contribution that is without a central organization or institution of governance. Sure, it is hosted, developed, and maintained by someone but they do not enforce any set of governance or process over the users of the&nbsp;system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new era, the &#8220;GitHub Era&#8221;, requires no such internalization of ethos. People and their contributions are as transparent as we can imagine and the direct connection of these people to each other turn social problems back into social problems rather than political problems. The barrier to getting a contribution somewhere meaningful has become entirely social, in other words it is now the responsibility of the community, whether that community is 2 or 2000&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>A system that enforces its principles without intervention is a tremendous achievement and GitHub&#8217;s adoption trend should not be a surprise to&nbsp;anyone. </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.beyondagile.com/blog/so-it-was-time-to-start-this-blog.html">If I had to describe, in just a few paragraphs, my own approach to placing people at the heart of IT, I&#8217;d probably say that it&#8217;s based mainly on two concepts</a> :</p>
		<p>	<ul>
		<li>The first one is that I see software development as a systemic, empirical activity (as opposed to a sequential, deterministic one); and I&#8217;d like to add that, although I find some use in applying the theory of complex adaptive systems to IT teams, that&#8217;s not what I mean by &#8216;systemic&#8217; — but more on this later</li>
		<li>The second concept is that, when working and dealing with teams, I find that each individual&#8217;s capacity and willingness for self-development is fundamental to the well-being of the whole team and, therefore, to the entire organization and to all the stakeholders</li>

For some reason (probably Microsoft&#8217;s strong-arm marketing and lawyers) it has been a standards browser in the enterprise sector (large companies) for a long time, but has been changing fast.</p>

	<p>ii) Firefox, Safari and Chrome are open source browsers which follow web standards. They have fewer bugs and are easier to use. More people in the world use Firefox than IE now.</p>

	<p>iii) The web should be accessible to all, regardless of web browser. IE usually breaks things, and web developers despise it for this reason. Best practices are to develop websites for open source browsers which respect web standards <span class="caps">FIRST</span>, and <span class="caps">THEN</span> code workarounds for IE bugs.</p>

		<p>The funny thing is, no one&#8217;s really hiding the secret of how to make awesome online communities. Give people something cool to do and a way to talk to each other, moderate a little bit, and your job is done. Games like Eve Online or WoW have developed entire economies on top of what&#8217;s basically a message board. MetaFilter, Reddit, LiveJournal and SA all started with a couple of buttons and a textfield and have produced some fascinating subcultures. And maybe the purest (!) example is 4chan, a Lord of the Flies community that invents all the stuff you end up sharing elsewhere: image macros, copypasta, rage comics, the lolrus. The data model for 4chan is three fields long &#8211; image, timestamp, text.</p>
		<p>Now tell me one bit of original culture that&#8217;s ever come out of Facebook.</p>

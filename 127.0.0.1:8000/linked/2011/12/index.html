	<blockquote>
		<p><em>From your Web site it looks like you&#8217;ve worn a number of hats. How do you mainly earn your living by penetration testing, developing software as a contractor, or what? Or do you have a day job? (I won&#8217;t ask where). Do you have any advice for software engineers seeking an independent career?</em></p>
		<p>I was the <span class="caps">CTO</span> at WhisperSystems, which was just acquired by Twitter. In the past, I&#8217;ve done both contract and full-time software engineering work, and I&#8217;ve worked on boats and as a delivery captain. I&#8217;ve also spent a considerable amount of time being broke and living without money. </p>
		<p>I don&#8217;t think I have any particularly sage advice for software engineers looking to go independent, so I&#8217;ll answer a different question: on a somewhat regular basis now, I receive inquiries from young people coming out of high-school or college, asking me what they should do to get started in their software or security career. My most common response is &#8220;don&#8217;t do it.&#8221; Or at least, not right now. </p>
		<p>I think the biggest thing young people fail to realize is the interminable nature of a career. As a young person in the global north, your whole life is generally marked by periods with definite beginnings and endings: elementary school is 5 years, middle school is 3 years, high-school is 4 years. It&#8217;s significant because when you&#8217;re in high-school and hating the indignity of it all, there is at least a definite endpoint that you can look forward to. But if you&#8217;re coming out of that, you might not fully comprehend that when you start a career, you&#8217;re expected to do that&#8230; for the rest of your <strong>life</strong>! Don&#8217;t be too anxious to jump into that, because it&#8217;s not as different as what&#8217;s come before as you might think. </p>
		<p>A friend of mine recently quipped &#8220;most people working in software discovered technology before they discovered themselves.&#8221; There are so many people in the industry working on projects without a real personal narrative as to <strong>why</strong> they&#8217;re doing them, other than the intrinsic feeling that solving technical problems is fulfilling. There is a whole entrepreneurial scene in the Bay Area right now; I can understand the draw of building things, but the level of self-seriousness that people bring to something like a &#8220;customer loyalty&#8221; startup baffles me. Honestly, it&#8217;s simply not true that this stuff is &#8220;changing the world,&#8221; so don&#8217;t be too concerned about missing out if you don&#8217;t jump in as quickly as you can. </p>
		<p>Please, don&#8217;t spend your late teens or early twenties in front of your computer at a startup. If you&#8217;re a young person, I think the very best thing you could do is get together with a group of friends and commit to a one year experiment in which the substantial part of your life will be focused on discovery and not be dedicated to wage work &#8212; however that looks for you. Get an instrument, learn three chords, and go on tour; find a derelict boat and cross an ocean; hitchhike to Alaska; build a fleet of dirigibles; construct a <span class="caps">UAV</span> that will engage with the emerging local police <span class="caps">UAV</span>s; whatever &#8212; but make it count.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>&#8230;</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><em>Completely unrelated to your work, but the name &#8220;Moxie Marlinspike&#8221; sounds wonderful. It&#8217;s obvious why you chose &#8220;Marlinspike&#8221;, after all as a sailor it&#8217;s an object that you may have found useful (and it&#8217;s not that uncommon to have a last name that is a tool or a trade). But the first name you chose &#8211; why did you choose it? Looking around for references to Moxie the most prominent one is for one of the earliest carbonated beverages sold in the world, which doesn&#8217;t sound too probable as an origin.</em></p>
		<p>&#8230;</p>
		<p>The notion of &#8220;realness as legality&#8221; is interesting to me because it seems like it should be possible for reality to extend beyond whatever is defined by law, yet this seems to be the litmus in most people&#8217;s minds. If I have a name which literally everyone in my life since childhood has known me by, it seems to me that this should be the definition of &#8220;reality,&#8221; not whether the government (who, by contrast, has a pretty cold and distant relationship with me as far as acquaintances go) agrees.</p>

<p>The conditions that allow the network to challenge the power of governments and corporations can be traced to the origin of the Internet and the Cold War zeitgeist that made the network we know possible. It was only because Cold War strategists had to narrate to themselves the unfolding of convoluted thermonuclear apocalypse scenarios, a dark art that peaked with Herman Kahn&#8217;s surreal book On Thermonuclear War, that a computer network with the characteristics of the internet was&nbsp;implemented.</p>
<p>The idea of imminent apocalypse was so extraordinary that it allowed for the radical thinking that over a decade evolved into the <span class="caps">TCP</span>/<span class="caps">IP</span> computer protocol suite, a resilient network protocol that makes the end user of the network its primary agent. The design philosophy of the internet protocols represents a clean break from the epistemes and continuums that had historically informed the evolution of Western power, as traced by Foucault and Deleuze from sovereign societies to disciplinary societies to societies of&nbsp;control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What journalists around the world have failed to narrate is the tale of a network that increasingly challenges, bypasses and outcompetes the global corporate-government complex. This is a struggle about the obsolescence of the very idea of the nation-state, and an almost unanimous coalition of governments, led by the <span class="caps">US</span>, fighting furiously to regain control by exerting legal, financial, symbolic and, perhaps most concerning, technical violence on their&nbsp;adversary.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>On a scale of one to ten, how good of a cog are you? How well do you function in your assigned role? How much of a man or woman are you? How do you rate yourself as a son or daughter, father or mother, wife or husband, heterosexual or homosexual, liberal or conservative, black or white, winner or loser, shark or sheep, introvert or extrovert, Christian, Muslim, atheist? How smart are you? How rational? How emotional? Do people like you? Are you getting ahead, or falling behind?</p>
		<p>How do you know? Are you keeping an eye on the others in your category, comparing to see how you measure up to your peers? Is it more important for a man to be tall, or to have good hair?</p>
		<p>This is, of course, the path of insanity, and not the good kind of insanity.</p>
		<p>What will you do if you&#8217;re too tough to be a good woman, too sensitive to be a good man, too selfish to be a good husband, too lazy to be a good employee, too shy to be a good friend, too caring to be rational, too fat to be pretty, too effeminate to be straight, too introverted to be a good leader, too smart to be kind, too young to be taken seriously, too old to make a difference, or too far behind to even get in the race?</p>
		<p>These are all false standards and false dichotomies, but they are so common and so ingrained that we sometimes believe in them without even realizing it.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>And <a href="http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2011/02/two-paths-to-success.html">on learning</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The approach I stumbled into is based on intrinsic motivation. To the greatest extent possible, do whatever is most fun, interesting, and personally rewarding (and not evil). External constraints, such as the need to go to school or make money are simply obstacles to be <a href="http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2009/10/applied-philosophy-aka-hacking.html">hacked</a>. Be skeptical of external authorities, as they are often manipulating you for their own benefit, or for the benefit of the institutions they represent (often unknowingly, as they were already captured by the same systems which are attempted to ensnare you). Your identity comes from within &#8212; external recognition such as degrees and awards are only of tactical importance &#8212; don&#8217;t allow them to define who you are.</p></blockquote>

		<p>It bugged us that most consumer devices lacked repair instructions. We think it should be easy for people to learn how to fix things.</p>
		<p>So we wrote some instructions the first chance we got. And we posted them online, for free. For the first time, it was easy for someone with no technical background or experience to take apart a Mac. Our step-by-step instructions were enabling people to repair Macs they wouldn&#8217;t have been able to repair on their own.</p>

	<p>&#8230;</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>We&#8217;re working on creating much more repair information for devices of all kinds. Our philosophy is that if you can&#8217;t open it, you don&#8217;t own it. Once you disassemble, repair, and put back together your laptop or iPod, you have a much better understanding of what goes into it. It&#8217;s astounding how just 20 minutes of work and $10 can make an iPod good as new &#8212; but most people have no idea that there are instructions available to make the work easy. And why should they? Apple tells everyone that the battery isn&#8217;t user-serviceable. That&#8217;s where we come in, filling the ecosystem hole that Apple created by manufacturing a device without an end-of-life maintenance and disposal strategy.</p>

<p>Sometime in 2009, I&#8217;d seen coverage of something happening in Todmorden that intrigued me. Locals there had apparently agreed to work together to try and become self-sufficient from the perspective of food. Their initial focus was on fruit and vegetables, and the intention was to move on to grain, to white meat and finally to all the food types they felt they would&nbsp;need.</p>

		<p>What I am sure about is this: Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr are temporary constructions on the Web, like Worlds Fairs used to be, when we still had them. The Internet is a world where all four seasons happen at once. New sites and services are like plants that germinate, grow, bud, bloom and die, over and over. Even the big trees donâ€™t grow to the sky. We need their fruit, their shade, their wood and the humus to which they return. Do we need the other crap that comes along with it those stages? Maybe not, but we go for it anyway.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is it about numbers that made you want to figure them&nbsp;out?</em></strong></p>
<p>It’s just like asking, “Why does a violinist like to play the violin?” I had this skill with mathematical tools, and I played these tools as well as I could just because it was beautiful, rather in the same way a musician plays the violin, not expecting to change the world but just because he loves the&nbsp;instrument.</p>

<p><strong><em>You became a professor at Cornell without ever having received a Ph.D. You seem almost proud of that&nbsp;fact.</em></strong></p>
<p>Oh, yes. I’m very proud of not having a Ph.D. I think the Ph.D. system is an abomination. It was invented as a system for educating German professors in the 19th century, and it works well under those conditions. It’s good for a very small number of people who are going to spend their lives being professors. But it has become now a kind of union card that you have to have in order to have a job, whether it’s being a professor or other things, and it’s quite inappropriate for that. It forces people to waste years and years of their lives sort of pretending to do research for which they’re not at all well-suited. In the end, they have this piece of paper which says they’re qualified, but it really doesn’t mean anything. The Ph.D. takes far too long and discourages women from becoming scientists, which I consider a great tragedy. So I have opposed it all my life without any success at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p><strong><em>How is it that you were able to escape that&nbsp;requirement?</em></strong></p>
<p>I was lucky because I got educated in World War <span class="caps">II</span> and everything was screwed up so that I could get through without a Ph.D. and finish up as a professor. Now that’s quite impossible. So, I’m very proud that I don’t have a Ph.D. and I raised six children and none of them has a Ph.D., so that’s my&nbsp;contribution.</p>

<p>One of the miseries of life is that everybody names things a little bit wrong. And so it makes everything a little harder to understand in the world than it would be if it were named differently.

<p>You see, education is a process of ruining subjects for you and the last subject to be ruined determines your profession. Each subject is personified with the face of this local ogre, or perhaps in some cases with a wondrous person, who then represents that subject and you never find out that every subject has something in it of interest to you. Every subject can have something in it that you take into your heart. I thought I hated history, I thought I hated mathematics, because of the people I encountered and so some other way around. I would like to see a school system where you simply say to the kids at fourteen not “you have to sit here for four years and enduring and enduring and enduring and being endangered and insulted” but rather “You can get out of here as soon as you present for examination any of these any 80 of these 1000 mini-courses on this sheet. You can take more if you want and learn more before we send you out there. Have your choice.” Then I think we would see real motivation, because right now there is no way students can exercise initiative, except a) if they are male, disobeying, or b) if they are female, getting pregnant, or c) totally obeying and outdoing whatever the teacher wants, which is done by very few. Whereas if we give people a way to learn by initiative then we&#8217;d fix the problem but nobody wants to do&nbsp;that. </p>

<p>Carl Sagan talks about the possibility of an electron being a whole universe in the <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2014/03/cosmos/">Cosmos</a> episode <em><a href="http://vimeo.com/68346365">The Edge of Forefever</a></em> (around 55 minutes and 10 seconds&nbsp;in):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the Cosmos <em>is</em> closed, there&#8217;s a strange, haunting, evocative possibility — one of the most exquisite conjectures in science or religion. It&#8217;s entirely undemonstrated — it may never be proven — but it&#8217;s <em>stirring</em>. Our entire universe, to the furthest galaxy, we are told, is no more than a closed electron in a far grander universe we can never see. And that universe is only an elementary particle in a still greater universe, and so on, forever. Also, every electron in our universe, it is claimed, is an entire miniature cosmos, containing galaxies and stars and life, and electrons. Every one of <em>those</em> electrons contains a still smaller universe — an infinite regression, up, and down. Every human generation has asked about the origin and fate of the cosmos. Ours is the first generation with a real chance of finding some of the answers. One way or another, we are poised at the edge of&nbsp;forever.</p>

<p>And from <em><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/17/gravitational-waves-bicep-inflation-big-bang">What Are Gravitational Waves?</a></em>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Einstein knew that general relativity did not mesh with another theory of physics called quantum mechanics. Whereas general relativity talks about gravity and the universe as a whole, quantum mechanics talks about the small scale of particles and the other forces of nature, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and electromagnetism. Despite almost a century of effort, the world&#8217;s physicists have not been able to show how these theories work together. The primordial gravitational waves were generated when gravity and the universe were working on the same scale as particles and the other forces of nature. This detection and the subsequent analysis will hopefully tell us how. If it does, this could lead to what physics wistfully call &#8220;the theory of&nbsp;everything&#8221;.</p>

<p>Dave&nbsp;Thomas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is how to do something in an agile&nbsp;fashion:</p>
<p><strong>What to&nbsp;do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Find out where you&nbsp;are</li>
<li>Take a small step towards your&nbsp;goal</li>
<li>Adjust your understanding based on what you&nbsp;learned</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to do&nbsp;it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When faced with two of more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that makes future change&nbsp;easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s it. Those four lines and one practice encompass everything there is to know about effective software development. Of course, this involves a fair amount of thinking, and the basic loop is nested fractally inside itself many times as you focus on everything from variable naming to long-term delivery, but anyone who comes up with something bigger or more complex is just trying to sell you&nbsp;something.</p>

<p>Docker can run within a <span class="caps">VM</span>, or on your computer if you&#8217;re not on a Macintosh (Mac&#8217;s kernel is&#8230;for now&#8230;not supported). I usually create a Vagrant virtual machine of CoreOS, which works with Docker very&nbsp;nicely.</p>
<p>Docker is a utility which uses &#8220;containers&#8221;. Docker containers are usually used to run one process at a time (apache or mysql or python or grep or anything,&nbsp;really).</p>
<p>You can connect multiple docker containers to create a functioning app. Running one for database and other one for running your code would a simple&nbsp;example.</p>

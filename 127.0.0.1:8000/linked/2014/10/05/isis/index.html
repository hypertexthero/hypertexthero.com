<blockquote>
<p>I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>I came to a high place of darkness and light
The dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away he was not ordinary
He said &#8220;Are you looking for something easy to catch ?&#8221;
I said &#8220;I got no money&#8221;. He said &#8220;That ain&#8217;t&nbsp;necessary&#8221;.</p>
<p>We set out that night for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word
I said &#8220;Where are we going ?&#8221; He said &#8220;We&#8217;d be back by the fourth&#8221;
I said &#8220;That&#8217;s the best new that I&#8217;ve ever&nbsp;heard&#8221;.</p>
<p>I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold
I was thinking about diamonds and the world&#8217;s biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so&nbsp;reckless.</p>
<p>How she told me that one day we meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could hang on and just be her friend
I still can&#8217;t remember all the best things she&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice
He said &#8220;There&#8217;s a body I&#8217;m trying to find
If I carry it out it&#8217;ll bring a good prize&#8221;
It was then that I knew what he had on his&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn
When he died I was hoping that it wasn&#8217;t contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to go&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I&#8217;d been had
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly
When I took up his offer I must-a been&nbsp;mad.</p>
<p>I picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time then I rode on&nbsp;ahead.</p>
<p>She said &#8220;Where ya been ?&#8221; I said &#8220;No place special ?&#8221;
She said &#8220;You look different&#8221; I said &#8220;Well I guess&#8221;
She said &#8220;You been gone&#8221; I said &#8220;That&#8217;s only natural&#8221;
She said &#8220;You gonna stay ?&#8221; I said &#8220;If you want me to, Yeah&nbsp;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Isis oh Isis you mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling&nbsp;rain.</p>

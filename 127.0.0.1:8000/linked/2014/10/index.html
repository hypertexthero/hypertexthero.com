<p>But, even as a child, I found that it presented me with a puzzle: how can a plane fly inverted (upside down). When I pressed my 6th grade science teacher on this question, he just got mad, denied that planes could fly inverted and tried to continue his lecture. I was very frustrated and argued until he said, &#8220;Shut up, Raskin!&#8221; I will relate what happened next later in this&nbsp;essay.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish I could send this essay to the 6th grade science teacher who could not take the time to listen to my reasoning. Here&#8217;s what happened: he sent me to the principal&#8217;s office when I came in the next day with a balsa model plane with dead flat wings. It would fly with either side up depending on how an aluminum foil elevator adjustment was set. I used it to demonstrate that the explanation the class had been given must have been wrong, somehow. The principal, however, was informed that my offense was &#8220;flying paper airplanes in class&#8221; as though done with disruptive intent. After being warned that I was to improve my behavior, I went to my beloved math teacher who suggested that I go to the library to find out how airplanes fly&#8212;only to discover that all the books agreed with my science teacher! It was a shock to realize that my teacher and even the library books could be wrong. And it was a revelation that I could trust my own thinking in the face of such concerted opposition. My playing with model airplanes had led me to take a major step toward intellectual independence&#8212;and a spirit of innovation that later led me to create the Macintosh computer project (and other, less-well-known inventions) as an&nbsp;adult.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the cosmos is closed, there&#8217;s a strange, haunting, evocative possibility. One of the most exquisite conjectures in science or religion. It&#8217;s entirely undemonstrated, it may never be proved, but it&#8217;s stirring. Our entire universe, to the farthest galaxy, we are told, is no more than a closed electron, in a far grander universe we can never see. And that universe is only an elementary particle in another still greater universe, and so on, forever. Also, every electron in our universe, it is claimed, is an entire miniature cosmos containing galaxies and stars and life, and electrons. Everyone of those electrons contains a still smaller universe, an infinite regression up and&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Every human generation has asked about the origin and fate of the cosmos. Ours is the first generation with a real chance of finding some of the answers. One way or another, we are poised at the edge of&nbsp;forever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>I came to a high place of darkness and light
The dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away he was not ordinary
He said &#8220;Are you looking for something easy to catch ?&#8221;
I said &#8220;I got no money&#8221;. He said &#8220;That ain&#8217;t&nbsp;necessary&#8221;.</p>
<p>We set out that night for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word
I said &#8220;Where are we going ?&#8221; He said &#8220;We&#8217;d be back by the fourth&#8221;
I said &#8220;That&#8217;s the best new that I&#8217;ve ever&nbsp;heard&#8221;.</p>
<p>I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold
I was thinking about diamonds and the world&#8217;s biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so&nbsp;reckless.</p>
<p>How she told me that one day we meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could hang on and just be her friend
I still can&#8217;t remember all the best things she&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice
He said &#8220;There&#8217;s a body I&#8217;m trying to find
If I carry it out it&#8217;ll bring a good prize&#8221;
It was then that I knew what he had on his&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn
When he died I was hoping that it wasn&#8217;t contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to go&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I&#8217;d been had
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly
When I took up his offer I must-a been&nbsp;mad.</p>
<p>I picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time then I rode on&nbsp;ahead.</p>
<p>She said &#8220;Where ya been ?&#8221; I said &#8220;No place special ?&#8221;
She said &#8220;You look different&#8221; I said &#8220;Well I guess&#8221;
She said &#8220;You been gone&#8221; I said &#8220;That&#8217;s only natural&#8221;
She said &#8220;You gonna stay ?&#8221; I said &#8220;If you want me to, Yeah&nbsp;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Isis oh Isis you mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling&nbsp;rain.</p>

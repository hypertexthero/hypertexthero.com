		<p>h1.&nbsp;Hyper-who?</p>
<p><img class="thumbincontent" src="/images/me_camera_wide.jpg" alt="A photograph of Hypertexthero." title="A photograph of Hypertexthero." style="float:right; padding:0 0 1em 1.5em;" /></p>
<p>Hypertexthero is a small design studio specializing in usable, &#8220;high quality web and graphic design&#8221;:/. I&#8217;m Simon Griffee, the&nbsp;pilot!</p>
<p>I learned to use computers while hacking <span class="caps">MS</span>/<span class="caps">DOS</span> to make games run in the early 1990s.[1] After completing a Creative Advertising Design degree from Bournemouth University in 1999, I realized that the majority of things are not very good at all and certainly not worth the effort spent to convince other people to buy&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>I taught myself graphic design and <span class="caps">HTML</span> and worked in small internet start-ups and large organizations. I am passionate about the internet which I believe to be one of humanity&#8217;s greatest&nbsp;inventions.</p>
<p>I am most delighted when doing worthwhile design work, when being with great art or people, when &#8220;photographing (Photographs by Simon Griffee.)&#8221;:http://simongriffee.com, when in the flow. I record interesting sites I come across in my internet travels in the&nbsp;&#8220;Logbook&#8221;:/logbook/. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s &#8220;my résumé&#8221;:/cv/, some of my &#8220;code&#8221;:http://github.com/hypertexthero and my &#8220;contact&nbsp;details&#8221;:/contact/.</p>
<p><txp:hide></p>
<p>After a short time I decided that commuting to and spending every week day in an office were not what I wanted to live for. Rather, I wanted to work more comfortably and travel more often, so Hypertexthero came to&nbsp;be. </p>
<p>I am passionate about the internet which I believe to be one of humanity&#8217;s greatest inventions.
h3. Why Hire&nbsp;Me</p>
<p>You need a modern website that looks good and is simple to use. You appreciate elegant graphic design that lets your audience hear your voice. <a href="/cv" title="My Curriculum Vit&aelig;.">I am an experienced designer</a> known for &#8220;idiosyncratic work of high quality and effect (See a list of selected work.)&#8221;:/work/. I am &#8220;trained in advertising (<span class="caps">BA</span> in Creative Advertising from Bournemouth University.)&#8221;:/cv#bournemouth but don&#8217;t believe all things are worth selling. I believe that content should determine the technology, not the other way around. I am &#8220;a member (The Guild of Accessible Web Designers - Members Information - Simon Griffee.)&#8221;:http://www.gawds.org/showmember.php?memberid=1218 of the &#8220;Guild of Accessible Web Designers (<span class="caps">GAWDS</span>.org)&#8221;:http://www.gawds.org. I like to work on projects that &#8220;do no harm (Milton Glaser.)&#8221;:http://www.miltonglaser.com/pages/milton/essays/es3.html. I start with pencil and paper. I believe in technology working for people, not people working for machines. I think &#8220;web standards (Find out why web standards are important at the Web Standards Project website.)&#8221;:http://www.webstandards.org/about/ are &#8220;good for business(The business value of web standards.)&#8221;:http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000266.php and for &#8220;us all (The architects of <span class="caps">HTML</span> saw we were going digital and sat back and took a long view. A very long view.)&#8221;:http://www.thenoodleincident.com/tutorials/box_lesson/why.html. I believe in working to live, not living to&nbsp;work.</p>

h3.&nbsp;History</p>
<p>Hypertexthero launched in May of 2005 when I left my home in &#8220;Formello (Sito internet di Formello.)&#8221;:http://www.lcnet.it/reticiviche/formello/formello.html, Italy to try living as a nomadic designer. I&#8217;m happy to say I&#8217;ve managed so&nbsp;far.</p>

<p>fn1. If the work is interesting and the people are fun to work with my opinion about working in an office, as all my opinions, can change. Open minds are important.
</txp:hide></p>
<p>fn1. These days I am a little smarter and use &#8220;better software&#8221;:http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/software-used-2011 such as <span class="caps">OS</span> X and other *x&nbsp;systems.</p>

        <blockquote>
<p>The B Ark is technically named &#8220;Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B&#8221;. The Golgafrincham civilization hatched a plan to eliminate its society of its most useless workers, namely its service sector and its paper shufflers. The Golgafrinchans created a legend that their world was about to be destroyed and they needed to build three arks. In Ark A they would put all the high achievers, the scientists, thinkers, artists, and important leaders. In Ark C they would put all the blue-collar workers, the people that build and make things. In Ark B they would put everyone else: hairdressers, <span class="caps">TV</span> producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, and management&nbsp;consultants.</p>
<p>The B Ark was constructed, loaded up, and launched first. However, it was automatically set for a collision course with Earth&#8217;s sun, to finally rid Golgafrincham of these twits. And naturally, no A or C ark was ever&nbsp;made.</p>

<p>But, even as a child, I found that it presented me with a puzzle: how can a plane fly inverted (upside down). When I pressed my 6th grade science teacher on this question, he just got mad, denied that planes could fly inverted and tried to continue his lecture. I was very frustrated and argued until he said, &#8220;Shut up, Raskin!&#8221; I will relate what happened next later in this&nbsp;essay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish I could send this essay to the 6th grade science teacher who could not take the time to listen to my reasoning. Here&#8217;s what happened: he sent me to the principal&#8217;s office when I came in the next day with a balsa model plane with dead flat wings. It would fly with either side up depending on how an aluminum foil elevator adjustment was set. I used it to demonstrate that the explanation the class had been given must have been wrong, somehow. The principal, however, was informed that my offense was &#8220;flying paper airplanes in class&#8221; as though done with disruptive intent. After being warned that I was to improve my behavior, I went to my beloved math teacher who suggested that I go to the library to find out how airplanes fly&#8212;only to discover that all the books agreed with my science teacher! It was a shock to realize that my teacher and even the library books could be wrong. And it was a revelation that I could trust my own thinking in the face of such concerted opposition. My playing with model airplanes had led me to take a major step toward intellectual independence&#8212;and a spirit of innovation that later led me to create the Macintosh computer project (and other, less-well-known inventions) as an&nbsp;adult.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the cosmos is closed, there&#8217;s a strange, haunting, evocative possibility. One of the most exquisite conjectures in science or religion. It&#8217;s entirely undemonstrated, it may never be proved, but it&#8217;s stirring. Our entire universe, to the farthest galaxy, we are told, is no more than a closed electron, in a far grander universe we can never see. And that universe is only an elementary particle in another still greater universe, and so on, forever. Also, every electron in our universe, it is claimed, is an entire miniature cosmos containing galaxies and stars and life, and electrons. Everyone of those electrons contains a still smaller universe, an infinite regression up and&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Every human generation has asked about the origin and fate of the cosmos. Ours is the first generation with a real chance of finding some of the answers. One way or another, we are poised at the edge of&nbsp;forever.</p>

        <p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis_%28song%29">Bob Dylan</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>I came to a high place of darkness and light
The dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away he was not ordinary
He said &#8220;Are you looking for something easy to catch ?&#8221;
I said &#8220;I got no money&#8221;. He said &#8220;That ain&#8217;t&nbsp;necessary&#8221;.</p>
<p>We set out that night for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word
I said &#8220;Where are we going ?&#8221; He said &#8220;We&#8217;d be back by the fourth&#8221;
I said &#8220;That&#8217;s the best new that I&#8217;ve ever&nbsp;heard&#8221;.</p>
<p>I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold
I was thinking about diamonds and the world&#8217;s biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so&nbsp;reckless.</p>
<p>How she told me that one day we meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could hang on and just be her friend
I still can&#8217;t remember all the best things she&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice
He said &#8220;There&#8217;s a body I&#8217;m trying to find
If I carry it out it&#8217;ll bring a good prize&#8221;
It was then that I knew what he had on his&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn
When he died I was hoping that it wasn&#8217;t contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to go&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I&#8217;d been had
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly
When I took up his offer I must-a been&nbsp;mad.</p>
<p>I picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time then I rode on&nbsp;ahead.</p>
<p>She said &#8220;Where ya been ?&#8221; I said &#8220;No place special ?&#8221;
She said &#8220;You look different&#8221; I said &#8220;Well I guess&#8221;
She said &#8220;You been gone&#8221; I said &#8220;That&#8217;s only natural&#8221;
She said &#8220;You gonna stay ?&#8221; I said &#8220;If you want me to, Yeah&nbsp;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Isis oh Isis you mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling&nbsp;rain.</p>

<p>We’re in danger of losing what’s made the Internet the most important medium in history – a decentralized platform where the people at the edges of the networks – that would be you and me – don’t need permission to communicate, create and&nbsp;innovate.</p>
<p>This isn’t a knock on social networks’ legitimacy, or their considerable utility. But when we use centralized services like social media sites, however helpful and convenient they may be, we are handing over ultimate control to third parties that profit from our work, material that exists on their sites only as long as they&nbsp;allow.</p>
<p>Even if most people don’t recognize what’s at stake – yet – I’m happy to say that a small but growing group of technologists does. And they’ve created what they call the “Indie Web” movement to do something about it, in an extended online conversation and at periodic in-person&nbsp;meetings.</p>

He even clashed with Orthodox Jews in one well-known instance: The religious Jews he met on his trek around Europe would not let themselves be photographed, quoting the Bible and its prohibition of making of graven images. Vishniac&#8217;s famous response was, &#8220;the Torah existed for thousands of years before the camera had been&nbsp;invented.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishniac was known for having great respect for all living creatures. Whenever possible, he returned a specimen to its precise home before it was captured and one time &#8220;[lent] his bathtub to tadpoles for weeks until he could return them to their pond&#8221;. In accordance with this philosophy, he photographed almost exclusively living&nbsp;subjects.</p>

    <p><a href="http://hypertexthero.com/static/img/elite/deep-space-milky-way-fullsize.jpg"><img alt="Deep Space in the Milky Way." src="/static/img/elite/deep-space-milky-way.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><em>Looking into a side of the Milky Way from the Asellus system in <a href="http://elitedangerous.com/" title="An amazing computer game.">Elite: Dangerous</a>. The glowing red star is Asellus Primus B, 0.16 light years&nbsp;away.</em></p>
<p>Thunder ends the hyperspace jump and we are now in a different here in a different now with glowing orb of fire filling our view. Hazard proximity sensors are going off and we maneuver away toward points of light in the darkness of space — some very bright, others invisible if not for the navigation overlays which indicate the orbits and positions of celestial bodies in this system. We are in Super Cruise mode, a sort of crawling speed setting in the space travel throttle and the ideal way to fly around the local solar system with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift" title="Redshift astronomical phenomenon.">red and blue-shifting</a> star and dust trails all&nbsp;around.</p>
<p>As we gather speed away from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star" title="Star.">ball of plasma</a> the blackness of space begins to fade away, gradually revealing the number of other stars there and then. The heavens begin to change colour, blues and violets of interstellar clouds of dust, nebulae illuminating the glinting night, a long section of which is bright as an Earth day. The middle of this bright river of light is the center of <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-video-game-that-maps-the-galaxy" title="The Video Game That Maps The Galaxy.">our own Milky Way galaxy</a>, another point of which we have&nbsp;reached. </p>
<p>Second burst of thunder and we are now out of Super Cruise in local time where Newton&#8217;s maths of motion rule our ballet. Thrusters up, throttle forward, flight assist off, push stick forward slowly, then release. The distant jewels now spin slowly around us in the infinity of the universe. Black sphere with half-circle sliver of light perpendicular to thin illuminated ring of giant dust rises from the horizon of our lower dashboard, followed by a crescent moon, and then a cuboctahedron — a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect" title="The Coriolis effect.">Coriolis</a>&nbsp;station.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Elite_1985_Firebird_Software_ZX_Spectrum" title="Try the ZX Spectrum version of the original Elite at archive.org."><img alt="The original Elite." src="/static/img/elite/elite-bbc.gif" /></a>
<em>Shortly after leaving a space station in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_%28video_game%29" title="Revolutionary.">original Elite</a> from 1984 running on a <a href="http://www.g7jjf.com/" title="By Jon Welch."><span class="caps">BBC</span> Micro emulator</a>.</em></p>
<p>Approaching, we <em>feel</em> the size of the station. As towers and other appendages of this spinning city in space fly by our ship we <em>hear</em> the moan of a massive structure. As in film, <a href="http://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=8236" title="Meet the Team #10- Jose Castro (Sound Designer).">sound</a> and <a href="http://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=11961" title="Meet the Team #12- Jim Croft (Head of Audio).">music</a> help form the whole of our flying experience. Staccato popping-and-buzzing of directional thrusters, twanging sounds of a 1970&#8217;s cross-between-<span class="caps">VW</span>-bus-and-space-shuttle <em>Hauler</em> ship engine, heaving heavy machinery opening cargo bay or landing gear doors; utter silence followed by crunching of ice crystals forming around cockpit glass panes when switching off systems to reduce heat signature and disappear from sensors. 
<a href="/logbook/2014/07/elite-dangerous-education/" title="Elite: Dangerous Education.">Elite</a>&rsquo;s orchestra puts us here inside a ship flying in space, our hands and feet on the controls, cockpit&#8217;s metal frames moving with inertia casting dancing shadows in pools of colored light from stars, planets, stations, our own and other ships, their engines glinting, tracing a disappearing line in the immensity of the <a href="/logbook/2014/03/cosmos/" title="Carl Sagan's Cosmos.">cosmos</a>.</p>
<p>We align ourselves with the the entrance and match the Coriolis&#8217; rotation. Now the stars are moving and we, along with the station, are&nbsp;still.</p>
<p>We have <a href="https://archive.org/details/Elite_1985_Firebird_Software_ZX_Spectrum" title="Try the ZX Spectrum version of the original Elite at archive.org.">come</a> <a href="http://elitedangerous.com/" title="Elite: Dangerous.">far in 30 years</a>.

        <p>The itch to try a new programming language is there again. <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> seems a good choice, which I might explore using the <a href="http://mbutterick.github.io/pollen/doc/">Pollen</a> publishing system that is written in&nbsp;Racket:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the core of Pollen is an&nbsp;argument:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, that digital books should be the best books we’ve ever had. So far, they’re not even&nbsp;close.</li>
<li>Second, that because digital books are software, an author shouldn’t think of a book as merely data. The book is a&nbsp;program.</li>
<li>Third, that the way we make digital books better than their predecessors is by exploiting this&nbsp;programmability.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s what Pollen is&nbsp;for.</p>

    	  	<p>It&#8217;s good to read <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a> at least once a year, even if you&#8217;re not a software developer.</p>

	<p>What stood out for me on this reading is that <em>good taste matters</em>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>I think it is not critical that the coordinator be able to originate designs of exceptional brilliance, but it is absolutely critical that the coordinator be able to <em>recognize good design ideas from others</em>.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>And so does <em>joy</em>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s12.html">Enjoyment predicts efficiency</a>.</p>
		<p>Relating to your own work process with fear and loathing (even in the displaced, ironic way suggested by hanging up Dilbert cartoons) should therefore be regarded in itself as a sign that the process has failed. Joy, humor, and playfulness are indeed assets; it was not mainly for the alliteration that I wrote of &#8220;happy hordes&#8221; above, and it is no mere joke that the Linux mascot is a cuddly, neotenous penguin.</p>
		<p>It may well turn out that one of the most important effects of open source&#8217;s success will be to teach us that play is the most economically efficient mode of creative work.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>List of points taken from the body of the essay:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer&#8217;s personal itch.</li>
		<li>Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).</li>
		<li>&#8220;Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.&#8221; (Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month, Chapter 11). (Or, to put it another way, you often don&#8217;t really understand the problem until after the first time you implement a solution. The second time, maybe you know enough to do it right. So if you want to get it right, be ready to start over at least once <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s14.html#JB">[JB]</a>.)</li>
		<li>If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.</li>
		<li>When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.</li>
		<li>Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.</li>
		<li>Release early. Release often. And listen to your custome</li>
		<li>Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone. (Or, less formally, &#8220;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.&#8221; I dub this: &#8220;Linus&#8217;s Law&#8221;.)</li>
		<li>Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.</li>
		<li> If you treat your beta-testers as if they&#8217;re your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.</li>
		<li> The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.</li>
		<li> Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.</li>
		<li> &#8220;Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.&#8221;</li>
		<li> Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.</li>
		<li> When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possibleâ€”and <em>never</em> throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!</li>
		<li> When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.</li>
		<li> A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.</li>
		<li> To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.</li>
		<li> Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.</li>

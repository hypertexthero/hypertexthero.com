		<h1><a href="/logbook/2014/05/mackeeper-draft/" rel="permalink" title="Permanent link to this entry.">MacKeeper Draft</a></h1>
		<p class="quiet"><time pubdate="pubdate">Thursday, May 22 2014</time></p>
		<p>A friend who bought his first Mac recently asked about anti-virus software after installing MacKeeper and spending €80. I explained that anti-virus software is <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2014/03/reasons-i-currently-use-mac/#fn:1">not necessary</a> as long as you <a href="http://www.reedcorner.net/mmg-antivirus/">are careful and use common sense</a>. I can&#8217;t put it any better than <a href="http://www.reedcorner.net/">Thomas Reed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another important thing to know is that no <span class="caps">AV</span> software is capable of intercepting a brand-new virus. When a new virus appears, that virus must become widespread enough to be noticed by the companies publishing <span class="caps">AV</span> software. Then they must find a copy of the virus, examine it and add it to the list of virus definitions used by their software. And, of course, none of that does you any good until you actually download the update, which doesn’t happen immediately. This means that, even if a particular <span class="caps">AV</span> program worked with 100% efficiency, it still would be completely useless for a period of time after the introduction of a new virus. In the case of the MacDefender outbreak, frequent name changes and minor tweaks to the “packaging” kept the MacDefender trojan variants one step ahead of all anti-virus software, for a day at a time here and&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Trojans also make extensive use of what is called “social engineering”. Much like phishing scams and other online fraud, they are often carefully designed to use fear, greed, lust and other emotions to fool you into doing what they want. The MacDefender trojans are a perfect example: a malicious JavaScript injected into a legitimate site redirects you to a page that tries to fool you into thinking viruses have been detected on your machine, and from there fools you into downloading and installing “anti-virus software”. In reality, that software is a trojan that will do its best to make you think you’ve got real viruses (even faking some symptoms), all while pestering you to buy the software to remove them. If you “buy” the software, you have given the criminals your credit card&nbsp;number.</p>
<p>Because of all this, blind usage of <span class="caps">AV</span> software can often make one more susceptible to infection by the right malware. If you become complacent, assuming that your <span class="caps">AV</span> software will protect you, it is unlikely that you will be as cautious as you should be, and something will eventually slip past your <span class="caps">AV</span> software. This is not just a theoretical concern, it has been documented to actually happen. I have personally seen reports from people with <span class="caps">AV</span> software who nonetheless got infected with&nbsp;something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do not install MacKeeper. If you have already installed it, <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/message/22927956#22927956">here&#8217;s how to remove it</a>, and here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.reedcorner.net/arg-identification/">more information on removing any crapware from your Mac</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Never click on links in or respond to unsolicited offers you receive by email</strong>, or on links <strong>in pop-up windows or in ads claiming that your computer is at risk</strong>.</p>
<p>The popularity of the iPad and the iPhone along with <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2013/09/bye-bye-microsoft/">Microsoft&#8217;s collapse</a> is encouraging many people to buy Macs. <a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/lawsuit-challenges-mackeepers-clean-computer-claims-012114.html" title="Lawsuit challenges MacKeeper's &quot;clean computer&quot; claims.">Hard-hearted software writers</a> are <strong>taking advantage of the fear these people brought from the Microsoft Windows world</strong> by marketing <strong>spurious software</strong> whose primary purpose is not to help them, but <strong>to convince them to part with their money</strong>.</p>
<p>Please <a href="http://www.thesafemac.com/ongoing-mackeeper-fraud/" title="Thomas Reed's website The Safe Mac is one of the best sources for information on protecting your Mac from malicious software.">beware</a>, and keep software like MacKeeper away from your&nbsp;Mac.</p>

		<h1><a href="/logbook/2014/03/web-publishing-maximum-longevity/" rel="permalink" title="Permanent link to this entry.">Web Publishing Workflow for Maximum Longevity</a></h1>
		<p class="quiet"><time pubdate="pubdate">Monday, March 31 2014</time></p>
		<p>After <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2014/03/textdrive-dead-jim/">TextDrive&#8217;s disorderly death</a> and the ensuing mess I&#8217;ve been thinking about the following&nbsp;question:</p>
<p><em>Given that one has something worthwhile to say,<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> what is the best way to assure the longevity of a personal<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> website published on the&nbsp;internet?</em></p>
<p>It is <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2011/11/dont-use-adobe-flash/" title="Don't Use Adobe Flash">obvious</a> that we should use <strong><a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">standard formats</a></strong> such as <strong>plain text</strong> and <strong><span class="caps">HTML</span></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free and open source software</a></strong> such as <a href="http://www.openssh.com/"><span class="caps">SSH</span> and <span class="caps">SFTP</span></a> and <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, and, ideally, though I&#8217;m no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite">luddite</a>, open source hardware (the one closest to this description I can think of is a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>). It is also probably a good idea <strong>not</strong> to use an unpaid third-party to keep your content online for you (see TextDrive link&nbsp;above).</p>
<p>So what is the <strong>simplest workflow</strong> to publish something that <strong>will last</strong> on the&nbsp;web?</p>
<p>And what is the easiest way to make a copy of things regularly so you can easily move them to a different publishing space if needed or restore them if they disappear? Cron job running <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html">wget</a> or <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone"><code>git clone</code></a> to backup a website to another server once a&nbsp;week?</p>
<div style="background:#ffc;">
<b><span class="caps">TODO</span>:</b> Finish this post with at least one suggested solution.

<h2>Minimum Actions to Publish a Document&nbsp;Online</h2>
<p><em>…Which stays online provided you, or someone, continues to pay the domain name and hosting space&nbsp;fees.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.webfaction.com/">Rent</a> <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">hosting space</a>, specify auto-renewal of payment provided you have funds. Make note of <span class="caps">DNS</span> <span class="caps">IP</span> addresses for pointing a domain name to this hosting&nbsp;space.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gandi.net/">Rent</a> <a href="https://gun.io/blog/secure-your-domain-where-is-safe-to-register-a-domain-name/">domain.ch</a>, specify auto-renewal of payment provided you have funds. Configure domain name settings to point to <span class="caps">DNS</span> <span class="caps">IP</span> addresses of the hosting space&nbsp;above.</li>
<li>Write, draw and or&nbsp;photograph.</li>
<li>Save text or image locally in folder on own device. If drawing or photographing on another device, transfer images to own device capable of&nbsp;publishing.</li>
<li>Input <span class="caps">FTP</span> settings of rented hosting&nbsp;space.</li>
<li>Publish by dragging and dropping, clicking &#8216;Publish&#8217; or typing a command in a terminal and hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
<li>The document is published online at&nbsp;domain.name/folder/structure/document-title.html</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Additional Things Which Would Be Nice To&nbsp;Have</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A duplicate copy of the entire system easily made and copiable to any other device by running a command such as <code>git clone</code>. Local copy of items preserved in a folder structure which mirrors the one online. Editable documents using local system&nbsp;tools. </li>
<li><a href="http://hypertexthero.com/linked/2014/04/22/instant-wayback-url/">WayBack Machine pinged with <span class="caps">URL</span> of document</a> if it is still online one week after initial&nbsp;publishing.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may want to consider writing a note and giving it to trusted friends with instructions on what to do with your documents should you&nbsp;perish.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is something that has been on my mind a lot lately: evaluating technologies and services in terms of their long-term benefit instead of just their short-term hit. It’s something that we need to think about more as developers, and it’s certainly something that we need to think about more as&nbsp;users.</p>

<p>“But one thing would be clear about us: No one sends a message on such a journey, to other worlds and beings, without a positive passion for the future.

<p>Looks like we <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/content/chapters/12159.excerpt.pdf">need a satellite with lots of storage space in a high geosynchronous orbit (35,786 km above mean sea level) around the Earth</a> - See <a href="http://thelastpictures.org">The Last Pictures project</a>, &#8212; <a href="http://vimeo.com/53655801">video</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1963 <span class="caps">NASA</span> launched the first communications satellite “Syncom 2” into a geosynchronous orbit over the Atlantic Ocean. Since then, humans have slowly and methodically added to this space-based communications infrastructure. Currently, more than 800 spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit form a man-made ring of satellites around Earth at an altitude of 36,000 kilometers. Most of these spacecraft powered down long ago, yet continue to float aimlessly around the planet. Geostationary satellites are so far from Earth that their orbits never decay. The dead spacecraft in orbit have become a permanent fixture around Earth, not unlike the rings of Saturn. They will be the longest-lasting artifacts of human civilization, quietly floating through space long after every trace of humanity has disappeared from the planet’s&nbsp;surface.</p>
<p>Presented by public art organization Creative Time, The Last Pictures is a project to acknowledge these spacecraft as the monuments of our historical era. They are our Pyramids, our Stonehenge, and our Nazca lines. For nearly five years, artist Trevor Paglen interviewed scientists, artists, anthropologists, and philosophers to consider what such a cultural mark should be. As an artist in residence at <span class="caps">MIT</span>, he worked with materials scientists to develop an ultra-archival disc of images, capable of lasting in space for billions of&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>In September 2012, the television satellite EchoStar <span class="caps">XVI</span> will lift off from Kazakhstan with the archival disc attached to its anti-Earth deck, enter a geostationary orbit, and proceed to broadcast over ten trillion images over its fifteen-year lifetime. When it nears the end of its useful life, EchoStar <span class="caps">XVI</span> will use the last of its fuel to enter a slightly higher “graveyard orbit,” where it will power down and die. While EchoStar <span class="caps">XVI</span>’s broadcast images are destined to be as fleeting as the light-speed radio waves they travel on, The Last Pictures will continue to slowly circle Earth until the Earth itself is no&nbsp;more.</p>

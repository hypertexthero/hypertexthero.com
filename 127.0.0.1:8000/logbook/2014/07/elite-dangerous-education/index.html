		<h1><a href="/logbook/2014/07/elite-dangerous-education/" rel="permalink" title="Permanent link to this entry.">Elite: Dangerous Education</a></h1>
		<p class="quiet"><time pubdate="pubdate">Wednesday, July 23 2014</time></p>
		<p>In 1984 <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidBraben" title="David's on Twitter.">David Braben</a> and <a href="http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/elite/" title="Old school webpage — love it!">Ian Bell</a> managed to fit a simulated galaxy into 22 Kilobytes — a computer programming feat that inspired the <a href="http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-elite/">creation of the first internet newsgroup</a> as well as a generation of&nbsp;programmers.</p>
<p>Now, after a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461411552/elite-dangerous" title="25,681 Backers, £1,578,316 pledged of £1,250,000 goal.">crowdfunding campaign</a>, Braben is bringing the classic <em><a href="http://elite.frontier.co.uk/" title="Official Elite: Dangerous website.">Elite</a></em> computer simulation<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to a new generation, and this time it simulates what we know about our <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/07/the-video-game-that-maps-the-galaxy.html" title="The Videogame That Maps The Galaxy.">existing galaxy</a>, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEVutbSqBI0" title="Rules can be beautiful.">procedural programming</a> techniques based on real-world data filling in what we&nbsp;don&#8217;t. </p>
<p><a href="/static/img/elite/approaching-beagle-2-landing-fullsize.jpg" title="You can't see the station during Super Cruise, or at this distance (5.55 Light Seconds away)."><img alt="Beagle 2 Landing" src="/static/img/elite/approaching-beagle-2-landing.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><em>Approaching Beagle 2 Landing space station orbiting the Asellus A moon, which orbits the planet Asellus. The station is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/27dpl9/attention_when_this_post_is_half_an_hour_old/" title="Braben: In Frontier there were plenty of tributes too - for example to the wonderful late Richard Feynman - the planet 'Feynman' as the nearest exoplanet to Earth.">named</a> after <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/world/europe/colin-pillinger-70-dies-set-europes-eye-on-space.html" title="Colin Pillinger, Who Set Europe’s Eye on Space, Dies at 70.">Colin Pillinger and his Beagle 2 spacecraft</a>. Click the image to see a large&nbsp;version.</em> </p>
<p><em>Elite: Dangerous</em> provides a testing platform for future space exploration ideas from <a href="http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=dcbf6b86b4b0c7d1c21b73b1e&amp;id=7157d0e3e1" title="Modular space stations in Elite: Dangerous Newsletter #11.">engineering</a> to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/search?q=newsletters&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all" title="Links to other Elite: Dangerous newsletters on Reddit.">everything else</a>, and a <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2006/06/spacewar/" title="Space War, Computers and Education.">holistic education</a> about the <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2014/03/cosmos/" title="Carl Sagan's Cosmos.">cosmos</a> which the human species are still a living part of, although <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2014/07/violence/" title="Separating yourself from the rest of mankind.">barely</a>.</p>
<p>My first reaction to the <em>Elite: Dangerous</em> title was that it was a bit unfortunate, but after thinking of its portrayal of the immensity of our cosmos as a <em>dangerous idea</em> to the human status-quo of nationalism and organized religion, I now like it (these human themes are also present in the simulation — when we stop fighting over <a href="http://simongriffee.com/imaginarylines/" title="Imaginary Lines.">lines on maps</a> here on Earth, we may well begin fighting over them in&nbsp;space).</p>
<p>‘SteveWilds’ in the comments of <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-video-game-that-maps-the-galaxy" title="I can't find the comment anymore. If you know a link to it, please let me know.">The New Yorker’s</a> article:<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also explore this reconstructed galaxy in David Braben’s game. In fact the first and biggest player group in the game will be the First Great Expedition, whose goal is to travel as far into the simulation as possible, mapping and recording their discoveries as they go, as virtual scientific&nbsp;endeavour.</p>
<p>No other computer game has given people the opportunity to do this, let alone in a theoretically accurate simulation of this&nbsp;scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The work of Braben and his team at the aptly-named <a href="http://frontier.co.uk/" title="Frontier Developments website.">Frontier Developments</a> is art fused with science and engineering in the spirit of the <em>Renaissance</em>, exploring human themes of curiousity, communication and commerce, loneliness, fear and love, through our greatest <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2013/02/tools-change-thought-patterns/" title="Tools change thought patterns.">medium of communication</a> so&nbsp;far.</p>
<p><em>Elite</em> brings me joy because like the <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2011/12/a-tale-of-two-worlds/" title="The internet was developed during the Cold War.">internet</a> it shows that humans are capable of creating beauty during and despite of our continuing <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2014/07/education-and-world-peace/" title="Education and World Peace.">mass-stupidity</a>.</p>
<p>I will write more about <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2014/09/experience-flying-spaceship/">the experience of flying in a spaceship</a> next. For now, I leave you with <a href="http://pioneersread.wordpress.com/2011/07/27/the-canary-in-the-coal-mine-kurt-vonnegut-at-the-library/">Kurt Vonnegut</a>:<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I sometimes wondered what the use of any of the arts was. The best thing I could come up with was what I call the canary in the coal mine theory of the arts. This theory says that artists are useful to society because they are so sensitive. They are super-sensitive. They keel over like canaries in poison coal mines long before more robust types realize that there is any danger&nbsp;whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2014/04/climate-change-communication/" title="Climate Change Communication.">Carl Sagan</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For we are the local embodiment of a Cosmos grown to self-awareness. We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms; tracing the long journey by which, here at least, consciousness arose. Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we&nbsp;spring..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An education about our cosmos is needed now, more than&nbsp;ever.</p>
<p>Many thanks to David Braben and his team at Frontier for making this, and to all the Kickstarter&nbsp;backers!</p>

<p>But, even as a child, I found that it presented me with a puzzle: how can a plane fly inverted (upside down). When I pressed my 6th grade science teacher on this question, he just got mad, denied that planes could fly inverted and tried to continue his lecture. I was very frustrated and argued until he said, &#8220;Shut up, Raskin!&#8221; I will relate what happened next later in this&nbsp;essay.</p>

<p>I wish I could send this essay to the 6th grade science teacher who could not take the time to listen to my reasoning. Here&#8217;s what happened: he sent me to the principal&#8217;s office when I came in the next day with a balsa model plane with dead flat wings. It would fly with either side up depending on how an aluminum foil elevator adjustment was set. I used it to demonstrate that the explanation the class had been given must have been wrong, somehow. The principal, however, was informed that my offense was &#8220;flying paper airplanes in class&#8221; as though done with disruptive intent. After being warned that I was to improve my behavior, I went to my beloved math teacher who suggested that I go to the library to find out how airplanes fly&#8212;only to discover that all the books agreed with my science teacher! It was a shock to realize that my teacher and even the library books could be wrong. And it was a revelation that I could trust my own thinking in the face of such concerted opposition. My playing with model airplanes had led me to take a major step toward intellectual independence&#8212;and a spirit of innovation that later led me to create the Macintosh computer project (and other, less-well-known inventions) as an&nbsp;adult.</p>

		  <p>One thing that really distinguishes Simon is that he has both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ skills. He understands web development inside and out. At the same time he excels at listening to his colleagues and discerning what they really want. In fact, people often don't know what they want. I have seen Simon on many occasions patiently guide subject matter experts to an excellent solution saving otherwise wasted time and effort.</p>

		  <p>Apart from the layout and overall design, what is so wonderful about your work is your ability to blend the writing and the art in such a sophisticated way. One complements the other and the result is harmony and visual pleasure. Brilliant.</p>

		  <p>Hi Simon, your work always fascinates me. At first your pages look a bit oversimplified, almost ‘empty’. But then the realization that everything is there and easily found begins to emerge and they become a pleasure to use. I am very happy with the way it looks, well done!</p>

		  <p>Simon, As we finish another HS basketball season, as always, I bring up your memory. You are still the most natural passer and player I have ever coached. I am glad to finally get ahold of you again. Of course, by now basketball is probably just a historical event for you. I see that you are now successful in the world. If you are in China, look me up. All the best. Coach Elliott</p>

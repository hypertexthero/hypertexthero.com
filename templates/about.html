<p>
<b>Web development:</b>  
Wireframing, HTML, CSS, some JavaScript and backend, web standards and open source software. If a tool is the right one for the job I&rsquo;ll use it. 
</p>
<p>
<b>User experience design, usability, accessibility:</b> 
Fast, simple interfaces and <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2012/04/web-design-where-to-begin/">good writing</a> over excessive style. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Photography:</b> 
Candid photography, usually on the street using Leica rangefinder cameras and Fuji and Ricoh compacts. I want a <a href="/logbook/2013/09/design-good-camera/" title="Design Specifications for a Good Camera.">better, more affordable camera for photography students</a> and <a href="http://simongriffee.com/notebook/editing" title="Editing means culling, improving, condensing, simplifying — removing the unnecessary, leaving the best. In this sense, when applied to photographs, and if you want to improve your photography, I think ‘editing’ is a better word than ‘organizing’ or ‘management’, and it should be embraced in its traditional sense.">better editing software</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Software:</b> 
Web browsers (Firefox and Chrome) and their developer tools, Textmate and a Terminal prompt, Sketch, Lightroom, Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. I have experience with Python and Django that I also use to edit hypertexthero.com on a local development server that is then published with rsync and version controlled with Git and <a href="https://github.com/hypertexthero" title="I’m not a great coder, but I can hack things together.">Github</a>. I also know a bit of Ruby and Jekyll, some Apache and Nginx configuration, a tiny bit of MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite, and a little Unix system administration. <a href="/logbook/2015/01/software-2015/">Here&rsquo;s the software I&rsquo;m using in 2015</a>.</p>

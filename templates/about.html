  I like working with people to move things from an existing condition to a preferred one. 
  Visually, interactively or experientially, it is all <a href="/work/" title="See selected work.">design</a>. I draw <a href="http://simongriffee.com" title="See my photographs.">with</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/hypertexthero/projects/356239-Drawing" title="Some of my drawings on Dribbble.">without</a> cameras to observe, understand and then hopefully craft and convey information that helps make <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/work/earth-among-the-stars/" title="Earth among the stars in HTML and CSS.">our world</a> a better place.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Brazil, my childhood was spent on the move there. I learned English in Tunisia and to see in Italy. I currently live in New York City where I work part of my time as a designer and printer in <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2526907-Brazilian-Pizza" title="I am lucky to have been able to work with my mentor. Milton's Graphic Design changed my life.">Milton Glaser</a>’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vmguBgxZyE" title="A wonderful film of Milton made by the late, great Hillman Curtis.">studio</a> and at <a href="/work/columbia-italian-academy/" title="At the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America.">Columbia University</a>.</p>

  <p>Thank you to everyone who has read my stuff over the years and given me such positive feedback. I would never have had the balls to apply for this job otherwise. Especially Simon Griffee who by encouraging me to write in the first place has unwittingly changed the course of my entire career. I owe you a visit and copious beers :)</p>

  <p>Simon, As we finish another HS basketball season, as always, I bring up your memory. You are still the most natural passer and player I have ever coached. I am glad to finally get ahold of you again. Of course, by now basketball is probably just a historical event for you. I see that you are now successful in the world. If you are in China, look me up. All the best. Coach Elliott</p>

  <p>One thing that really distinguishes Simon is that he has both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ skills. He understands web development inside and out. At the same time he excels at listening to his colleagues and discerning what they really want. In fact, people often don’t know what they want. I have seen Simon on many occasions patiently guide subject matter experts to an excellent solution saving otherwise wasted time and effort.</p>

  <p>Apart from the layout and overall design, what is so wonderful about your work is your ability to blend the writing and the art in such a sophisticated way. One complements the other and the result is harmony and visual pleasure. Brilliant.</p>

	<p>I have known Mr. Griffee professionally for nearly three years and have found him to be a conscientious employee, outstanding worker and of fine character.

  <p>Hi Simon, your work always fascinates me. At first your pages look a bit oversimplified, almost ‘empty’. But then the realization that everything is there and easily found begins to emerge and they become a pleasure to use. I am very happy with the way it looks, well done!</p>

<p>I <a href="/logbook/2009/08/learning-by-doing/" title="Learning by doing.">learned</a> to work with computers with <a href="/logbook/2006/06/spacewar/" title="Space War, Computers and Education.">computer games</a>.

I learned HTML and CSS by viewing the source of websites I liked, searching with <a href="http://google.com" title="In 2001 while working at a startup in Rome, Italy.">Google</a> and with Jeffrey Zeldman’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designing_with_Web_Standards">Designing With Web Standards</a>. I learned user experience, usability and accessibility principles from a book called <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/" title="The End of Business as Usual.">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> and from <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/" title="UseIt">Jacob Nielsen’s Alertbox column</a>. I learned photography by <a href="http://simongriffee.com" title="My photographs.">taking</a> and <a href="http://simongriffee.com/notebook/editing" title="Editing.">looking at</a> photographs</a>.

I’ve been learning some <a href="/logbook/2013/07/europython-2013-notes/" title="See my notes from EuroPython 2013 in Florence, Italy.">Python</a> and enjoyed meeting <a href="/logbook/2013/07/europython-2013-notes/#goodenough" title="‘Good Enough’ is Good Enough!">Alex Martelli in Florence in 2013</a>.</p>

</h2>
<p>
<b>Web development:</b>  
I like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, web standards and open source software. If a tool is the right one for the job I&rsquo;ll use it. 
</p>
<p>
<b>User experience design, usability, accessibility:</b> 
I like fast, simple interfaces and <a href="http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2012/04/web-design-where-to-begin/">good writing</a> over excessive style. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Photography:</b> 
I <a href="http://simongriffee.com" title="See my photography at simongriffee.com">work</a> with Leica rangefinder cameras and Fuji and Ricoh compacts. I want a <a href="/logbook/2013/09/design-good-camera/" title="Design Specifications for a Good Camera.">better, more affordable camera for photography students</a> and <a href="http://simongriffee.com/notebook/editing" title="Editing means culling, improving, condensing, simplifying — removing the unnecessary, leaving the best. In this sense, when applied to photographs, and if you want to improve your photography, I think ‘editing’ is a better word than ‘organizing’ or ‘management’, and it should be embraced in its traditional sense.">better editing software</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Software:</b> 
I spend most of my time in Photoshop, Sketch, Illustrator, Lightroom, InDesign and in Textmate and a Terminal prompt. I also have some experience with <a href="/logbook/2013/07/europython-2013-notes/" title="See my notes from EuroPython 2013 in Florence, Italy.">Python</a> and Django, PHP, Wordpress, Drupal and Textpattern, Ruby and Jekyll, Git and <a href="https://github.com/hypertexthero" title="I’m not a great coder, but I can hack things together.">Github</a>, Apache and Nginx, a little MySQL and PostgreSQL and a bit of Unix system administration. <a href="/logbook/2015/01/software-2015/">Here&rsquo;s the software I&rsquo;m using in 2015</a>.</p>

{#   <p>One thing that really distinguishes Simon is that he has both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ skills. He understands web development inside and out.
